Initial spec
============

Choice of file format
---------------------

Json files were chosen for the following reason:

 -  Plain data.
 -  Natively supported by nix.
 -  Widely supported by tools.
 -  Easy to create tooling to modify / read those files.

The downside of json:

 -  No comments (possible to circumvent by using dummy attributes names).
 -  More verbose than any of the below alternatives.


It would have been possible to use the following as well:

 -  Nix:

     -  Natively supported.
     -  Not plain data, so not easy to develop robust tools to modify / read
        those (Turing complete languages cannot be easily modified by tooling) unless we limit
        ourselves to its plain data subset.
     -  As a programming language, could however be used to generalize some boilerplate.

    Note that this might be a possible extension to optionally allow companion
    nix files.

 -  TOML:

     -  Also natively supported by nix.
     -  Not yet as widely supported nor as easy to modify / read by custom
        tools.
     -  A bit ugly hybrid between `.ini` files and structured yaml.
     -  Now has `rq` xpath like tool too for easy manipulations.

 -  YAML:

     -  Really nice human editable format.
     -  Plain data, tough harder than json to support as parser support varies.
     -  Nice `yq` xpath like tool built on top of the json one (`jq`).
     -  Not natively supported by nix. This can be circumvented by creating a
        intermediate derivation and then use [Import From
        Derivation](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Import_From_Derivation). This is
        however not without costs and has implications in terms of the level of
        nix sandboxing that will be available to us were we to choose this
        option.


Users and groups definition
---------------------------

`./device-ssh/users.json`:

```json
{
  "ssh-user-defaults": {
      "pubkey-file-template": [
        "${ssh-user.name}.pub",
        "${ssh-user.name}.rsa.pub"
      ],
      "pubkey-file-search-path": [
        "./public-keys-override",
        "./public-keys",
        "./public-keys-inherited"
      ],
  },
  "ssh-users": {
    "my-super-factory-tech-user-f0": {},
    "my-factory-tech-user-f1": {},
    "my-factory-tech-user-f2": {},

    "my-tech-support-user-s1": {},
    "my-tech-support-user-s2": {},
    "my-tech-support-user-s3": {},

    "my-super-admin-user-a0": {
      "pubkey-file": "./admin-public-keys/my-super-admin-user-a0.pub"
    },
    "my-super-dev-user-d0": {
      "pubkey-file-template": "${ssh-user.name}.rsa.pub"
    },
    "my-backend-dev-user-d1": {}
  }
}
```

We might decide to support as well an inline specification of the key via
`pubkey-text`. However, this practice should be discouraged as the file will
become bloated making it harder to understand at quick glance.

You can see that when an attribute is missing, the default behaviour
specified in `ssh-user-defaults` is taken.

In the current case, it attempt the find the public key file in the
`pubkey-file-search-path` listing according to some templates `pubkey-file-template`
based on the given ssh user name. This scheme prevent repeating the same
information more than once, allow overrides / inheritance while leaving
it pretty explicit as to what should occur.

This new file format also has the following additional advantages:

 -  Leave room for expansion via top level keywords (e.g: `import` for importing
    other user definition files , etc).
 -  As the top level keywords are not variable (i.e: user names), it makes it easier
    to quickly validate the schema.
 -  This new schema would also allow one to combine the ssh-users with the
    ssh-groups and even with the `device-users` from the `always` file without
    even changing the tools.

TODO: Review used variable expansion scheme in template. Should we use another scheme?

TODO: It might be decided that sensible defaults are enforced when
`ssh-user-defaults.pubkey-file-template` or `ssh-user-defaults.pubkey-file-search-path`.
It would however come with the downside of bringing some implicit behaviour.

`./device-ssh/groups.json`:

```json
{
  "ssh-groups": {
    "my-admin-group-1": {
      "members": [
        "my-tech-support-user-s1"
      ]
    },
    "my-tech-support-group-2": {
      "members": [
        "my-tech-support-user-s2",
        "my-tech-support-user-s3"
      ]
    },
    "my-factory-install-group-3": {
      "members": [
        "my-super-factory-tech-user-f0",
        "my-factory-tech-user-f1",
        "my-factory-tech-user-f2"
      ]
    },
    "my-dev-group-4": {
      "members": [
        "my-super-dev-user-d0",
        "my-backend-dev-user-d1"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that these users and groups specification are unrelated to those users and
groups of the device themselves. Relations between machine users / groups and
ssh authorization users / group should be introduced in the next section.


Authorized on particular state
------------------------------

### Multi-files variant

`./device-ssh/authorized-always.json`:


```json
{
  "device-users": {
    "": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        "my-admin-group-1"
      ],
      "ssh-users": [
        "my-super-admin-user-a0"
      ]
    },
  }
}
```

The previous are that authorizations applicable for whichever state.

The following files define the access given when a device is attributed a
particular state:


`./device-ssh/authorized-on/factory-install.json`:

```json
{
  "device-users": {
    "": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        "my-factory-install-group-3"
      ],
      "ssh-users": [
        "my-super-factory-tech-user-f0"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


`./device-ssh/authorized-on/delivered.json`:

```json
{
  "device-users": {
    "backend": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        "my-tech-support-group-2"
      ],
    },
    "frontend": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        "my-tech-support-group-2"
      ],
    }
  }
}
```


`./device-ssh/authorized-on/dev.json`:

```json
{
  "device-users": {
    "": {
      "ssh-users": [
        "my-super-dev-user-d0"
      ],
    },
    "backend": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        "my-dev-group-4"
      ],
    },
    "frontend": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        "my-dev-group-4"
      ],
    }
  }
}
```


### Single file variant A

The following single file variant, attempting to leave device users at top level
would be possible too:

`./device-ssh/authorized.json`:

```json
{
  "device-users": {
    "": {
      "always": {
        "ssh-groups": [
          "my-admin-group-1"
        ],
        "ssh-users": [
          "my-super-admin-user-a0"
        ]
      },
      "on": {
        "factory-install": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-factory-install-group-3"
          ],
          "ssh-users": [
            "my-super-factory-tech-user-f0"
          ]
        },
        "dev": {
          "ssh-users": [
            "my-super-dev-user-d0"
          ],
        }
      }  
    },
    "backend": {
      "on": {
        "delivered": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-tech-support-group-2"
          ],
        },
        "dev": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-dev-group-4"
          ],
        }
      }
    },
    "frontend": {
      "on": {
        "delivered": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-tech-support-group-2"
          ],
        },
        "dev": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-dev-group-4"
          ],
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This single file variant seems much **less readable** then the multi-files one.


### Single file variant B

The following single file variant, a embedding of the multi-files one would be
possible too:

`./device-ssh/authorized.json`:

```json
{
  "always": {
    "device-users": {
      "": {
        "ssh-groups": [
          "my-admin-group-1"
        ],
        "ssh-users": [
          "my-super-admin-user-a0"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "on": {
    "factory-install": {
      "device-users": {
        "": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-factory-install-group-3"
          ],
          "ssh-users": [
            "my-super-factory-tech-user-f0"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "delivered": {
      "device-users": {
        "backend": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-tech-support-group-2"
          ],
        },
        "frontend": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-tech-support-group-2"
          ],
        }
      }
    },
    "dev": {
      "device-users": {
        "": {
          "ssh-users": [
            "my-super-dev-user-d0"
          ],
        },
        "backend": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-dev-group-4"
          ],
        },
        "frontend": {
          "ssh-groups": [
            "my-dev-group-4"
          ],
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This single file variant seems much **less readable** then the multi-files one.

We should then **implement the multi files variant**.
