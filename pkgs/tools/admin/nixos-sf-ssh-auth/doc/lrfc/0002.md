Auto expiring ssh authorization
===============================

The current system might be augmented to support simple temporary authorization that automatically expire.

Effectively, according to its specifications, openssh allow a `expiry-time`
attribute to each authorized key as follow:

```bash
$ cat /etc/ssh/authorized_keys
expiry-time="20180704" ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE...
```

We propose that our system might profit from this feature by simply overloading
entries from the authorized users or groups listing (from files such as above mentioned
`[core-cfg]/device-ssh/authorized-always.json`) to be attribute sets instead of strings.


An example:

```json
{
  "": {
    "authorized": {
      "ssh-groups": [
        { "id": "my-admin-group-1", "expiry-time": "20210704" }
      ],
      "ssh-users": [
        { "id": "my-super-admin-user-a0", "expiry-time": "202004200930" }
      ]
    }
  },
}
```

In the case of a user, the `expiry-time` attribute would be prepended the the
user's key.

Likewise, in the case of a group, the `expiry-time` would be prepended the the
keys of each users belonging to this group.

Note that this approach also extends to any other supported authorized key attributes.
