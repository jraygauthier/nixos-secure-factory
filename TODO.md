Exploring some ideas
--------------------

 -  See if we can reuse the [nix-deploy] tool.

[nix-deploy]: https://awakesecurity.com/blog/deploy-software-easily-securely-using-nix-deploy/


Issues
------

 -  `device-state-init-new` should check that factory info have been
    initialized before proceeding.

Improvements
------------

 -  Allow use of the user's gnupg keyring instead of the separate keyring.
 -  A tool to perform the first initialization of the gopass repositories.

    This will requires that url be taken / stored as well by the factory
    state init tool.
